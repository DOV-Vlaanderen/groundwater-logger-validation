## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Open the RStudio project file
3. Open the `index.Rmd` [R Markdown file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) in RStudio
4. Install any required packages
6. Click `Build > Build Book` to generate the processed data and build the website in `docs/`

## Publication

To publish an update of the dataset:

1. Open the [resource in the IPT](https://ipt.inbo.be/manage/resource.do?r=unified-checklist) (login required)
2. `Source data`: upload the newly generated data files from `data/processed`
3. `Darwin Core mappings`: does not require updates, unless terms were added/removed in the pipeline
4. `Metadata`: does not require updates, except for:
    - `Basic metadata`: in description, check if number of taxa (2.500+) still applies
    - `Taxonomic coverage`: in description, update numbers per kingdom based on [new data](https://trias-project.github.io/unified-checklist/6_dwc_mapping.html#preview-data)
    - `Temporal coverage`: update `End date` if need be
5. Publish: click `Publish`, add a short description and publish
6. Check if [dataset is updated](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/6d9e952f-948c-4483-9807-575348147c7e) at GBIF (can take a couple of hours)
