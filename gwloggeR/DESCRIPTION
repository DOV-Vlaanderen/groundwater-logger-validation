Description: Groundwater divers measure hydrostatic pressure, air pressure and
    temperature. These raw time series contain issues such as outliers,
    drift,... This package provides functions to facilitate the validation
    workflow of groundwater related time series. Each of the functions takes
    a time series and annotates problematic observations with a 
    controlled vocabulary of flags.
