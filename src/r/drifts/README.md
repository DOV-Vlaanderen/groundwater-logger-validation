This folder contains all the various drift analysis scripts.

Each script has a header which explains what it is used for.

Most scripts have an output folder. Some outputs are too large to be commited in GitHub.

Some scipts have been summarized as [issues](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/groundwater-logger-validation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aanalysis+label%3A%22air+pressure%22+). Note that the _Drift: xx_ issue corresponds to the _analysis_xx.r_ file here.
