Warning: Timeserie has intervals smaller than 12h. Measurements are averaged to 12h intervals.
Warning: Reference data has intervals smaller than 12h. Measurements are averaged to 12h intervals.
Warning: Given the 1 reference timeserie, there is for 5.85 % of barometer observations missing reference data.
Warning: More than 1 % of time intervals is larger than 12h. The current drift detection model works best for 12h interval measurements.
