### v0.01
Assumes normality of data and uses median and MAD as robust estimate of mu and sigma. (cf. [#2](/../../issues/2))

### v0.02
Assumes a-priori knowledge of air pressure data. (cf. [#3](/../../issues/3))

### v0.03
Improvement on v0.02 by using cleaned-up air pressure data. (cf. [#29](/../../issues/29))

### v0.04
Uses differences between observations and a-priori information about differences. For example, for 5 min intervals the maximal change is 10 cmH2O. (cf. [#27](/../../issues/27))
